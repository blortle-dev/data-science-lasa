# data-science-lasa

A repository to store completed excersices and notes for the Data Science Fundamentals class at LASA High School.

Course repository [here](https://github.com/thedarredondo/data-science-fundamentals).

## Setup

To run the models in projects, you can use either:
- Google Colab for a remote server
- An IDE such as DataSpell

Many of the Python packages used are preinstalled to Google Colab, however some packages (like bambi) aren't. You'll have to manually install it on some, as this repo is designed for IDE use.

If you're running it on an IDE, install the packages in the requirements.txt file to your Jupyter server.
